Hi, I'm Valentín. 👋

I specialize in **front-end web development** with an eye for logical, clean interfaces. What does that mean? I build web applications that make people say _"wow, that was easy."_

I created [Plande](https://plande.app), a web app that will change the way students plan and organize their college degrees.

You can know more about my experience and education on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentincostam/). And here is [my curriculum vitae](https://valentincosta.com/cv.pdf) if you're looking for that.
